## Overview

One of the things you'll notice as you start to write blog posts for the new CMS, is that many of the layout options you might be used to no longer exist. Probably the biggest thing that you won't be able to do is move and resize image as easily. You also won't have as much control over things like font size, colors, etc. But that's a good thing! Users on the site will appreciate the consistency from post to post.

## Workflow

The basic workflow for creating and publishing a blog post is similar to other pages on the site:

1. Create the post.
2. Add the appropriate metadata like categories and author.
3. Preview your draft.
4. Submit for publiciation.
5. Publishers approve post for publication.

> Note: We are using the submission process for blog posts to allow post writers to preview their posts. The publication / approval process isn't really necssary.

## Creating a blog post

1. Log in to the CMS.
2. From Structure, click on Assets.
3. Click on Add next to Blog post.

From here, you get a blank entry form for creating a blog post. When you start a new post, your first steps should always be to:

1. Give the post a title (be sure to see the Best practices section below).
2. Change your Entry date to the posts publication date.
4. If you know which category you want to use, check off a category.
3. Assign yourself as the author.

From here, go to the next section on "Writing a blog post"

## Writing a blog post

There are three main fields you need to pay attention to when you're writing a blog post:

- Homepage teaser
- Intro / Short Post
- Extended Entry

Let me tell you a little bit more about these.

#### Homepage teaser

The homepage teaser let's you customize a short teaser for the homepage. This is really useful if you are writing a post with a long lead in, or where the topic isn't readily apparent from the first two sentences. The teaser should always:

- Introduce the topic clearly
- Tell the reader what he or she will learn or get by reading

Even though the teaser isn't required, I think it is **very good idea** to use it.

#### Intro / short post**

What ever you type in this field appears in the list of blogs on the blog landing page (or index page as it is called). You can use this field if you are just writing a very short post. I think that it is more likely that this will be a solid intro paragraph to the rest of an article

> Best practice: The intro posts work best when they are *at least* 3 or 4 sentences long. You want it to be a fairly substantial block of text.

#### Extended Entry

The extended entry field holds the rest of your post. It's worth pointing out that when you view a a full post, you can't visually tell that the intro and extended entry are separate fields. That said, don't let it confuse you into putting all of your writing in the extended entry field.

### Before you start writing

Before you start writing (especially if this is your first post for the new blog), be sure to review the following pages in the docs:

- [Page editor](/page-editor/)
- [Style guide](/style-guide/)

## Blog categories

Currently we have 5 categories:

- Happening at the library: For library news, events, and other updates.
- Spotlight: For featuring content, resources, interviews, and other "feature" style posts.
- Staff picks: For recommendations of all kinds--books, movies, technology, etc.
- Kids & parents: For everything related to kids & parents, of course!
- How-to: For tutorial style posts, advice, guides, etc. 

There is also a meta category for blog posts:

- Suppress from homepage: Keeps a post off of homepage rotation

### When to use "Suppress from homepage"

There are a few reasons why you might want to use "Suppress from homepage". The main reason is if you want to post a blog post that doesn't fit in the posting schedule. Also, if you have two posts by the same author, you might want to suppress the older one. I think it is better to not have a person's face featured twice if at all possible.

### Editing blog categories

Only the admin account has the ability to edit categories. If there is a need to remove or edit categories, you do the following:

1. Log in as the admin account.
2. Click on Categories from the toolbar.
3. Choose "Add/Edit Categories" next to "Blog meta" or "Blog topics".

From here you can reorder, edit, or add categories. 

> **Note:** Be sure that you don't chance the sort order for the categories. It should be set to "Custom" so that the categories don't alphabetize.

## Images on the blog

Good quality images can make a blog post really sing. I think that working with images in blog posts will be much easier than it was in Blogger. On the flip side, though, you will have less control over the size and position of your images. But remember, we want our users to have a consistent and pleasant experience across the site.

There are three types of images you can put into your posts:

- Header image
- Full width image
- Right aligned image

Be sure to consult the documentation on finding and using images. Remember to try to use CC licensed images as much as possible.
